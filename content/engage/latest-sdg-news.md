The world’s governments, NGOs and companies are still working out how to respond to the SDGs, and how to measure them. Keeping up with countries’ progress on the SDGs on a real-time basis can be vital in pushing for policies and identifying the greatest opportunities for advancement.

The IISD hosts a {{< external-links src="http://sdg.iisd.org/" text="knowledge hub" >}} that tracks SDG-related news and announcements across the world - from summaries of new reports, to new initiatives, conferences and data sources. Each piece of news is tagged and classified by the SDGs that it relates to, making the site easily searchable. The site hosts policy briefs for turning thought into action, and invites guest contributors to present their ideas.
