The [Sulitest](https://www.sulitest.org/en/index.html) is the world’s first assessment tool for sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. The multiple-choice Sulitest aims to promote ‘sustainability literacy’, allowing students and employees at education institutions and companies around the world to learn about the SDGs. The Sulitest can be taken in ‘Learning Mode’, allowing users to learn along the way, or ‘Certificate Mode’, which grants a certification on completion - why not try your hand at it?
