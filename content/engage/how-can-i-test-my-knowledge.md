The {{< external-links src="https://www.sulitest.org/en/index.html" text="Sulitest" >}} is the world’s first assessment tool for sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. The multiple-choice Sulitest aims to promote ‘sustainability literacy’, allowing students and employees at education institutions and companies around the world to learn about the SDGs.
