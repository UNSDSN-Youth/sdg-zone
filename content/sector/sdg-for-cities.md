Cities and human settlements will be key to achieving the global SDGs. The SDGs came into effect in a world that is increasingly urban, with a little over half the global population now living in cities. Urbanization has thrown up some of the worldâ€™s greatest development challenges, but it also has tremendous opportunities for advancing sustainable development.

Habitat III was the first United Nations global summit after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals. It offered a unique opportunity to discuss the important challenge of how cities, towns, and villages are planned and managed in order to fulfill their role as drivers of sustainable development and, hence, shape the implementation of new global development and climate change goals.

For the implementation of the New Urban Agenda, Habitat III has opened a new mechanism.
