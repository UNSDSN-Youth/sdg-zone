One quarter of todayâ€™s global population is 15-30 years old - this is the largest and most educated youth population the world has ever seen. Through their skills, creativity, and enthusiasm, young people are creating on-the-ground solutions and delivering transformative change across multiple sectors of society. The solutions come from entrepreneurship to volunteering, scientific research, educational initiatives and all sorts of innovative endeavours. Young people have the stake and their well-being depends on actions being taken now. They will be the ones implementing the SDGs and leading countries towards sustainable development.
