The Youth Solutions platform is aims to showcase and support transformative youth-led initiatives in business, education, charity, and research which highlight the innovative approach that young people are taking in solving the multiple challenges of sustainable development. The platform provides young innovators with a powerful tool that addresses the difficulties they face in securing funding, building capacity, communicating their experience and ultimately scaling their efforts. 

As part of the Youth Solutions platform, SDSN Youth publishes a yearly Youth Solutions Report, which identifies 50 youth-led solutions that have demonstrated the clarity and viability of their strategy; their potential to be scaled and expanded, and their capacity to contribute to positive environmental and social outcomes.
