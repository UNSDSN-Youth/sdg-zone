Maybe you've asked yourself before: 'What can I, as a student, do about the SDGs?' Maybe you're not sure how to contribute, what actions could help, or simply where to start. Here are some ways you could get started:



**SDSN Member Institutions**

Find out if your university/ institution is a member of the {{< external-links src="http://unsdsn.org" text="United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)" >}}! SDSN is home to a global network of 700+ universities, research centres, and think tanks.

If your university is an SDSN member, you could reach out to your institution's leadership, and see if there are areas for students to help. A full list of SDSN member institutions in alphabetical order can be found at: {{< external-links src="https://networks.unsdsn.org/members" text="(https://networks.unsdsn.org/members)" >}}.

Your university isn't a part of SDSN? No problem. Why not write to your university's leadership and see if they'd be interested to join? Membership is free - more information about membership, and how to apply, can be found here: {{< external-links src="http://unsdsn.org/get-involved/join-the-sdsn/" text="(http://unsdsn.org/get-involved/join-the-sdsn/)" >}}.

The SDG Students Program is a flagship initiative of SDSN Youth, which aims to engage students in higher education in the global effort to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, as well as empower them with the knowledge, skills, and pathways to action to be effective agents of change today. As a global network of university hubs, we want to ensure all university students can learn about, engage with, and take action on the SDGs. If youâ€™re a university student looking to engage with the SDGs, develop and scale sustainable solutions for your community, join our network and become the newest member of the SDG Students Program.
