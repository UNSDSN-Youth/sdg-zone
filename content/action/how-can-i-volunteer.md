Many of the Sustainable Development Goals call for long-term attitude and behaviour changes. Volunteers facilitate changes in mindsets by raising awareness or championing those changes and inspiring others.
The 2030 Agenda recognizes volunteer groups as key stakeholders to achieve the 17 goals. Volunteerism is a powerful means of implementations, as it helps expand, mobilize and engage people under a common objective. 
The UN Volunteers is calling for individuals to bring their skills and expertise to contribute to meaningful and rewarding roles. Become a volunteer and take action on the SDGs today!
