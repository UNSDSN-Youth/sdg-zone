The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, are a set of 17 ambitious challenges for an green, prosperous, peaceful, and equal future. Designed carefully and painstakingly over several years of discussion at every level of society, the SDGs were officially adopted by the world’s political leaders in September 2015 at the UN General Assembly. The goals replace the eight Millennium Development Goals, which expired in 2015, and are broken up into [169 separate targets and 232 indicators](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/?area=MDG_WORLD). Between now and 2030, there is an enormous amount of work to do. Achieving the SDGs will require action from governments, civil society and companies of all shapes and sizes.

10 things you should know about the SDGs
------------------

  

1.  The idea for the SDGs was born at the 2012 Rio+20 Summit in Brazil, first suggested by the Colombian and Guatemalan governments to follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals.     
    
2.  The SDGs cover poverty, hunger, health, education, climate change, environment, gender equality, clean water, clean energy, decent work, cities, oceans, and much more.     
    
3.  Designing the goals took three years, 84 national surveys and over seven million people - the largest consultation in UN history.  
      
4.  The SDGs are designed to leave no one behind. They serve developed and developing countries, cities and villages, young and old, male and female.     
    
5.  Close links exist between the goals. Education in rural areas might depend on solar energy. Health in coastal towns is tied to the health of the ocean. Eradicating poverty means jobs will need to be created.  
       
6.  Governments are not the only ones supporting the SDGs. A huge number of NGOs are using the SDGs in decision-making, and a growing number of private companies are doing so too.     
    
7.  The SDGs want to change the way we think about economic growth and profit. They see economic success as closely tied to social and environmental responsibility.   
    
8.  193 countries agreed to a General Assembly resolution adopting the SDGs in September 2015. You can find the draft text [on the UN’s website](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/L.85&Lang=E).   
    
9.  Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Switzerland are expected to be the first countries to achieve the goals.  
    
10.  The SDGs aim to succeed where the Millennium Development goals failed by tackling the root causes of - for example - poverty, ill health, gender equality and environmental degradation.
