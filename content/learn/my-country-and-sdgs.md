While the SDGs themselves are easy to understand, measuring progress on them is much more difficult. The UN formed an Inter-Agency and Expert Group (IAEG) to come up with a list of quantifiable indicators for doing so at the international level. Other international organisations, NGOs and private companies have come up with a wide range of creative ways in which to measure progress on the SDGs most important to them. To ensure the indicators are brought into the political process, the UN also set up a High Level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development as a place for governments to (voluntarily) report their progress. The IISD, or International Institute for Sustainable Development, provides an [SDG indicator portal](https://sustainable-development-goals.iisd.org/country-data) that tracks how different countries are measuring SDG-related activity and progress, based on their submissions to the HLPF.

The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) has developed the [SDG Index](http://www.sdgindex.org) as the basis an independent ‘Report Card’ for each country. It measures progress on the UN indicators and publishes its findings every year in a series of reports.

A range of reports, [profiles for every country](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yvgzn5o4t19xigc/AACaTlUCxuwAe46z7Mj7iGg8a?dl=0) and even the underlying raw data are freely available to download, in the spirit of transparency. SDSN Youth provides helpful visual country-by-country [SDG Dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/profile/anastasiya.kostomarova#!/vizhome/SDGIndex2017RegionalDashboards_DRAFT/REGIONALDASHBOARDS?publish=yes), using the data from the Index to compare and contrast progress to date.
