**SDG INDEX**
---

While the SDGs themselves are easy to understand, measuring progress on them is much more difficult.  

The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Bertelsmann Stiftung have developed the [SDG Index](http://www.sdgindex.org/) as an independent ‘Report Card’ for each country. A range of reports, [profiles for every country](http://www.sdgindex.org/assets/files/2018/03%20SDGS%20Country%20profiles%20edition%20WEB%20V2%20050718.pdf) and even the underlying raw data are freely available to download, in the spirit of transparency. SDSN Youth provides helpful visualizations country-by-country [SDG Dashboards](https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/#/MLT), using the data from the Index to compare and contrast progress to date. Find out how your country is progressing!

The German Development Institute has created a tool that visually depicts every country's performance on the SDGs, comparing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the corresponding Sustainable Development Goals.
