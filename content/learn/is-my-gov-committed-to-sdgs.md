The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals was a historic moment. It was met with a standing ovation and applause, as all 139 Member States of the United Nation unanimously agreed to the new global agenda. These ambitious set of goals commit all signatory countries to address the root causes of poverty, whilst increasing economic growth and prosperity, meeting the health, education and social needs of the people, and ensuring the environment is protected.

As stated in the Declaration adopted by the world leaders, “Never before have world leaders pledged common action and endeavor across such broad and universal policy agenda. We are setting out together on the path towards sustainable development, devoting ourselves collectively to the pursuit of global development and of ‘win-win’ cooperation which can bring huge gains to all countries and all parts of the world.”
