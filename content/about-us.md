**What is the SDG ZONE?**
---

{{< padding >}}

The SDG Zone is a one-stop-shop for people to learn about the SDGs. There are four themes: Learn about the SDGs, Engage with the SDGs, Act on the SDGs and how is a certain sector engaged with the SDGs. We aim to educate people about the Sustainable Development Goals and engage interested audiences.
